# Getting-Started-with-TDD-in-Python

Hello, and welcome! If you're reading this, it means that you have successfully installed Git. :smile:

At MadeTech, we're big on pairing when we're approaching new topics or software. In the rest of the exercises, we'll be asking you to pair often and take regular breaks. It's not a trick! We work in this way to help us learn and to avoid burnout or enter the panic zone.

- For this exercise, we'll need to install the latest version of Python. Open up your terminal and type `python3 --version`. If you see something like `Python 3.xx.x` you have it installed. Otherwise head over [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install it. Once done, type the command above to make sure it's installed correctly.

- Now that we have Python, we'll need to install the Python koans-[koans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koan) allow us to learn something by exploring-letting curiosity be the guide :smile:
Now that you have Git installed, head to [this repository](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) and clone it (if you don't know, please feel free to ask!) Make a note of where it has placed the folder.

- We'll now need run the koans in the folder. On the command line, we'll need to navigate to the folder created. Once inside, enter the command `python3 contemplate_koans.py`. If everything goes well, you should see a message 'You have completed 0 (0 %) koans and 0 (out of 37) lessons.
You are now 304 koans and 37 lessons away from reaching enlightenment.'

We're now ready to begin!

Working in pairs, try to complete the koans one at a time **VERY IMPORTANT: speed isn't your friend! It's important to take your time and understand the steps along the way**
